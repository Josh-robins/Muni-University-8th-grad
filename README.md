## ❓ The Problem

The official graduation list is an **11-page PDF**, making it slow and frustrating to find a single name.

This becomes a challenge when:
- Friends want to know what course someone studied
- You need to quickly confirm graduation details
- **An employer wants to verify whether a candidate’s name appears on the graduation list**

Scrolling through a PDF isn’t practical for quick verification.

## 💡 The Solution

This project converts the graduation list into a **simple, fast search tool**.

- Search any graduate by name  
- Instantly view their academic program  
- Useful for graduates, classmates, and **employers doing quick checks**
